# Unreal Source #cpp Channel

As one of the most active topic-specific channels on Unreal Source, over the years `#cpp` has developed a number of cultural memes and quirks. This page has some information about that, in case you find it useful. 

The `#programmer-hangout` channel was spun off from `#cpp` to attempt to reduce the off-topic spirals that were occurring, seemingly because the chatters in `#cpp` do not find `#lounge` worthy. The effort has been quite successful.

# Memes

## _smol 32GB data table_

```yaml
{
    $type: 'discord',
    author: 'Xero',
    date: '11/14/2021 9:49AM',
    content: 'smol 32gb is a dragonHell level meme in my head (maybe me only tho)',
    link: 'https://discord.com/channels/187217643009212416/221799439008923648/808039744554401822'
}
```

Unfortunately the original message has been deleted. The original chatter was asking for advice on precomputing and storing line traces to speed up runtime performance on their game. The regulars remarked on how that was not a good idea, and would result in an extremely large amount of data to store and process in order to get a workable result at runtime. The user responded with something to the effect of 'it's just a smol 32GB data table'. 

It quickly became a meme often used when someone is suggesting a rather dumb way to increase performance, or minimizing how large a piece of data is.

## _dragonHell_

We can thank Josai for this one.

```yaml
{
    $type: 'discord',
    author: 'Miguel',
    date: '2/7/2021 10:21AM',
    content: 'Where is dragonHell i need some help with unreal',
    link: 'https://discord.com/channels/187217643009212416/221799439008923648/808039744554401822'
}
```

Out of the blue, a user appears asking for the help of (specifically) another user apparently named `dragonHell`. This confused the other chatters at the time, as there didn't appear to be (or has _ever_ been) a user named `dragonHell` on the server. 

```yaml
{
    $type: 'discord',
    author: 'sswires',
    date: '2/7/2021 10:22AM',
    content: 'and is "dragonHell" the only person who can help? lol',
    link: 'https://discord.com/channels/187217643009212416/221799439008923648/808040079859777577'
}
```

The original poster responded that, no, anyone would do to help solve their problem, but the match had been lit.

```yaml
{
    $type: 'discord',
    author: 'Josai',
    date: '2/7/2021 10:24AM',
    content: 'Nobody here knows UE like dragonHell (dunno who he is but he might be a god or something like that)',
    link: 'https://discord.com/channels/187217643009212416/221799439008923648/808040390108119040'
}
```

This has led to almost six hundred references to dragonHell on Unreal Source since. Perhaps dragonHell exists and is unaware that he is famous on this server, but more likely he's too busy writing god-like code for the Unreal games he's working on to notice us mere mortals.

## A bunch of idiots

On a crisp October day in 2021, little did Sourcerers know that they were about to miss the opportunity of a lifetime. Some may have been out to lunch, some may have been playing a video game. Some may have even been getting real work done, but none were there to help poor Timmy once he sent his block of C++ code. 

After a grueling 6 minutes without any reply whatsoever, Timmy had enough. 

```yaml
{
    $type: 'discord',
    author: 'Timmy',
    date: '10/23/2024 12:44PM',
    content: 'I figured it out. No one else will help me so',
    link: 'https://discord.com/channels/187217643009212416/221799439008923648/1298733865896116235'
}
```

```yaml
{
    $type: 'discord',
    author: 'Timmy',
    date: '10/23/2024 12:44PM',
    content: 'Thanks a lot guys. A bunch of idiots',
    link: 'https://discord.com/channels/187217643009212416/221799439008923648/1298733908090814465'
}
```

He then proceeded to permanently (for the time) leave the server.
One minute later the community returns from their collective bathroom break to see the irreparable damage to our community by losing such an icon of perseverence and will.

```yaml
{
    $type: 'discord',
    author: 'Greenosaur',
    date: '10/23/2024 12:45PM',
    content: 'hah, really?',
    link: 'https://discord.com/channels/187217643009212416/221799439008923648/1298734137091555348'
}
```

## Jeff

```yaml
{
    $type: 'discord',
    author: 'Blue Man',
    date: '12/17/2024 10:47PM',
    content: 'what about Jeff?',
    link: 'https://discord.com/channels/187217643009212416/1090768182131826748/1318832039784349768'
}
```

On one frigid day in December just a week or so before the holiday break, the Slackers were discussing Blueprint VM internals and recent VR games when suddenly,

```yaml
{
    $type: 'discord',
    author: 'Baffled',
    date: '12/17/2024 2:35AM',
    content: "New upload from the man the myth the legend :kappa:\n@Yakov congratulations",
    link: 'https://discord.com/channels/187217643009212416/1090768182131826748/1318526999735697438'
}
```

![Common Rhetoric](/public/images/unrealsource/jeff/common-rhetoric.png)

See, over the last few months before this occurrence, a lot of chatters had been sharing links to a YouTuber who had some dubious claims about game development, and specifically about how Unreal works and how it should be used to make performant games (he didn't seem to care about how they looked). 

Members of our community had tried to engage with this YouTube by posting comments on his videos and visiting his Discord server, in attempts to help correct misconceptions about how the technologies worked, their strengths and limitations, and how to use them optimally. But unfortunately this YouTuber responded by deleting every post that came close to criticism of his work.

The amount of people bringing up his videos on the server had been increasing and our regular users had already been tiring of discussing him and his toxic takes on game development, but alas a cooling on talk about this guy was not in the cards.

The above screenshot is from a video he had just posted in which he features many screenshots from the `#programmer-hangout` channel on Unreal Source discussing his videos. Most chatters were quite amused about this, though we would be dealing with random one-shot chatters who saw his video for months afterward. 

It became apparent that this person had been in the server and simply vanity-searching his own channel name so he could read about what people were saying. At no point did he actually try to _engage_ with the community on its criticisms though, and that tracks with the above reports of deleting critical comments on YouTube and his Discord.

A few of us thought that since he was clearly vanity searching his channel, perhaps we should come up with "codenames" to use to talk about him so he couldn't find it and throw it into another drama-stirring "toxic game devs" video. We weren't actually terribly concerned that he would repeat this again, but we didn't mind finding some small ways to foil him. 

Some suggestions were thrown out like "casio" and "buttercup" before we ultimately settled on the suggestion by Blue Man, one of the server's moderators:

```yaml
{
    $type: 'discord',
    author: 'Blue Man',
    date: '12/17/2024 10:47PM',
    content: 'what about Jeff?',
    link: 'https://discord.com/channels/187217643009212416/1090768182131826748/1318832039784349768'
}
```

...or as Jeff referred to him, "the admin of the server".

This has been an extremely long running meme, and though Jeff has seemingly calmed down as he's matured into adulthood, references to it are a regular occurrence in the server.
