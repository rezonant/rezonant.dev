# Unreal Source #cpp Channel

As one of the most active topic-specific channels on Unreal Source, over the years `#cpp` has developed a number of cultural memes and quirks. This page has some information about that, in case you find it useful. 

The `#programmer-hangout` channel was spun off from `#cpp` to attempt to reduce the off-topic spirals that were occurring, seemingly because the chatters in `#cpp` do not find `#lounge` worthy. The effort has been quite successful.
